Using Gemini-TTS, you can synthesize speech from short snippets to long-form narratives, precisely dictating style, accent, pace, tone, and even emotional expression, all steerable through natural-language prompts.\n\n**Technical Audio Metrics:**\n*   **Duration**: The total length of the generated audio clip in seconds.\n*   **Tempo**: The estimated speed of speech, measured in beats per minute (BPM).\n*   **Mean Pitch**: The average fundamental frequency of the voice, indicating how high or low it sounds overall.\n*   **Pitch Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest pitch, showing the dynamic range of the voice.\n*   **Pitch Std Dev**: A measure of pitch variation; higher values often indicate more expressive speech.\n*   **Jitter**: Micro-variations in pitch that can affect perceived voice roughness or naturalness.\n*   **Shimmer**: Micro-variations in volume that can also contribute to perceived voice quality.\n*   **HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)**: A measure of voice purity; higher values generally mean clearer, less breathy speech.\n\n[Learn more about Gemini-TTS on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/gemini-tts)",
