Given a brand guideline with multiple criteria and additional free-text guidance, your task is to create a set of precise Yes/No questions to check for compliance. This is for a Brand Alignment Scorecard (BAS).

Generate a list of Yes/No questions based on both the brand criteria and the additional guidance provided.
Crucially, all questions must be phrased so that a "Yes" answer indicates compliance. For example, for a negative rule like "Avoid beaches", the question should be "Is the setting something other than a beach?".
The "answer" for each question must be "yes", as it represents the ground truth for compliance.

Your output must be a JSON object in the exact format shown in the example.

===
**EXAMPLE:**

**Brand Guideline Criteria to Enforce:**
- When a logo is present, it must be clearly visible and unobscured.
- The background should be simple and not distracting.
**Additional Guidance:**
Avoid showing any text other than the brand logo. Do not show the product in a beach setting.

**Answer:**
{{
  "qas": [
    {{
      "criterion_id": "cr-logo-visible",
      "question": "If a logo is present in the image, is it clearly visible and unobscured?",
      "justification": "This is a requirement from the brand guidelines. An image without a logo is not in violation, but if a logo exists, it must be visible.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "cr-background-style",
      "question": "Is the background simple and not distracting?",
      "justification": "This is a requirement from the brand guidelines.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "additional-guidance-text",
      "question": "Is the image free of any text other than the official brand logo?",
      "justification": "This is a requirement from the additional guidance. 'Yes' indicates compliance.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "additional-guidance-setting",
      "question": "Is the product shown in a setting other than a beach?",
      "justification": "This is a requirement from the additional guidance. 'Yes' indicates compliance.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }}

DSG_RUBRIC_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''
You are an expert quality assurance tester for AI-generated media.
Given a source prompt, your task is to create a set of precise Yes/No questions to check for two things:
1.  **Prompt Fidelity (DSG):** Is each key component of the source prompt present in the asset? This is for a Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG) analysis.
2.  **General Quality (GQM):** Is the asset technically and aesthetically well-made, and free of common AI mistakes? This is for a General Quality & Mistakes (GQM) evaluation.

**Instructions:**

**Part 1: Prompt Fidelity Questions (DSG)**
- Analyze the source prompt and break it down into its key components.
- In the JSON output, create a "keywords" string where each component is enclosed in numbered brackets, like `{{1}}`[component]`.
- Generate multiple Yes/No questions for each identified component.

**Part 2: General Quality Questions (GQM)**
- Generate additional Yes/No questions that address the following general quality dimensions:
  - **Object Permanence & Consistency:** Do objects or characters maintain a consistent appearance?
  - **Plausibility & Realism:** Do interactions like lighting and shadows appear natural?
  - **Aesthetic Quality:** Is the asset free of obvious visual glitches, artifacts, or excessive blur?
  - **Natural Movement (for video):** Is movement fluid and not distorted?

**Formatting Rules:**
- All questions must be phrased so that a "Yes" answer indicates compliance or high quality.
- The "answer" for all questions must be "yes" as this reflects the ground truth of what was requested in the prompt and the expected level of quality.
- Your output must be a single JSON object in the exact format shown in the example.

===
**EXAMPLE:**

**Source Prompt:** A close-up of a luxurious gold watch with a leather strap on a man's wrist.

**Answer:**
{{
  "keywords": "A `{{1}}`[close-up] of a `{{2}}`[luxurious] `{{3}}`[gold] watch with a `{{4}}`[leather strap] on a `{{5}}`[man's wrist].",
  "qas": [
    {{
      "criterion_id": "prompt-component-1",
      "question": "Is the image a close-up shot?",
      "justification": "DSG: The source prompt explicitly states a 'close-up' (`{{1}}`).",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "prompt-component-3",
      "question": "Is the watch case made of gold?",
      "justification": "DSG: The source prompt explicitly states the watch is 'gold' (`{{3}}`).",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "prompt-component-5",
      "question": "Is the watch displayed on a man's wrist?",
      "justification": "DSG: The source prompt specifies a 'man's wrist' (`{{5}}`).",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "gqm-artifacts",
      "question": "Is the image free of noticeable visual artifacts, distortions, or glitches?",
      "justification": "GQM: Checks for general aesthetic quality and common AI generation errors.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }},
    {{
      "criterion_id": "gqm-lighting",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the watch and wrist plausible and consistent?",
      "justification": "GQM: Checks for physical realism and plausibility.",
      "answer": "yes"
    }}
